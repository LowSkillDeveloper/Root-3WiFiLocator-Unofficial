# Root-3WiFiLocator-Unofficial
Unofficial ROOT 3WiFi Locator for Android 


It doesn't work without root, but with root the WPS connection on Android 9 and 10 may work. And also empty WPS Pin is available.

decompiled locator-0.6beta2.2root and changed:
* Fix for android 9 (Permission for wifi on android 9 and 10)
* Updated to latest pin data from 3WiFi
* Updated pin.db (from latest "Wps Wpa tester").

For compil back use apktool:
**apktool b locator-0.6beta2.2root
